# Sprint 0 — Progress Log

**Sprint goal:** the `qalab test` command becomes reliable and its output becomes readable. Nothing changes product behaviour beyond fixing broken behaviour.

### B-001 · Enforce a real timeout on the Playwright runner
| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | **DONE** |
| **Date** | 2026-09-26 |
| **Duration** | 4m |
| **Commit** | `667f634` (1 of 11) |

**What changed**
- `PlaywrightTool`: subprocess stdout/stderr now redirected to a temp file instead of being drained on the calling thread. This is the actual bug — the inline drain blocked until process exit, so `waitFor(60s)` was unreachable and `destroyForcibly()` was dead code.
- Extracted `runProcess(List<String>, Path)` returning a `ProcessOutcome(boolean completed, int exitCode, long durationMs, String output)` record, which makes the timeout path deterministically testable without invoking npx.
- Budget configurable: `@Value("${qalab.playwright.timeout-seconds:600}")`, added to `application.yml` as `qalab.playwright.timeout-seconds`.
- Timeout path: kill tree → `waitFor(5s)` → return `status=TIMEOUT`, `timeoutSeconds`, and an actionable error naming the exhausted budget and how to resolve it (narrow the run, or raise the property).
- Replaced the unbounded `StringBuilder` with `readTail()`: retains at most the last 200 000 chars and announces truncation. Rationale: Playwright prints its per-test summary *last*, so the tail is the informative part — this also replaces the arbitrary 2000-char head-truncation that made output unreadable.
- Temp output file deleted in a `finally` block.

**How it was tested**
- New `PlaywrightToolTest` — 8 cases:
  - `sleep 60` under a 2 s budget is killed (asserts `completed == false` and elapsed < 30 s) — the regression guard for the original defect.
  - exit codes propagate for `exit 0` / `exit 3`.
  - stdout **and** stderr both captured (stderr merged via `redirectErrorStream`).
  - `execute()` with no target returns the "No test file specified" error.
  - `execute()` always returns a structured status and never hangs.
  - `readTail`: keeps the tail marker, announces truncation, is smaller than the original; returns whole small files; tolerates a missing file.
- Full suite: **135 tests, 0 failures** (127 pre-existing + 8 new). No regressions.
- Log inspection confirmed the 2 s budget firing (process started, no matching "execution completed" line).

### B-002 · Put real HTTP timeouts on every AI provider client
| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | **DONE** |
| **Date** | 2026-09-26 |
| **Duration** | 6m |
| **Commit** | `dc282a7` (2 of 11) |

**What changed**
- Added an `aiRestTemplate` bean in `AiGatewayConfig` using `SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory` with `connectTimeout=10s`, `readTimeout=180s`, both configurable via `qalab.ai.connect-timeout-ms` / `qalab.ai.read-timeout-ms` (added under the existing `qalab:` block in `application.yml`).
- Injected that bean into all **four** clients that were building their own: `OpenAiCompatProviderClient` (used by OpenAI/Google/Ollama), `AnthropicCompatProviderClient`, `OpenCodeAiProvider`, `OpenAiProvider`.
- `OpenCodeAiProvider` and `OpenAiProvider` now take the client via constructor instead of creating one in `@PostConstruct`.
- `grep "new RestTemplate()"` over `src/main/java` → zero occurrences.

Note: the read timeout is intentionally generous (180 s). Tightening it below real generation latency would convert slow-but-successful calls into failures; the point is that it is *finite*, so a stall becomes a retryable exception instead of a permanent hang.

Also caught: `ai/openai/OpenAiProvider.java` was a fourth bare `RestTemplate` not listed in the backlog's "three clients" — fixed in the same pass.

**How it was tested**
- New `AiHttpTimeoutTest` — 3 cases:
  - The bean's `connectTimeout`/`readTimeout` really are 10 000 / 180 000 (read reflectively off the request factory, so a silent revert to `0` fails the test).
  - **Functional proof:** a `ServerSocket` that accepts the connection and never writes a response. With `read-timeout-ms=400` the call must throw, and must do so in < 4 s. This is the direct regression guard for "hung forever".
  - Architectural guard: walks `src/main/java/com/qalab/qalabai/ai` and fails if any file reintroduces `new RestTemplate()`.
- Full suite: **138 tests, 0 failures** (135 + 3 new).
- Log confirms the bean logs `connectTimeout=1000ms readTimeout=400ms` for the test profile and the production values for the default.

## Notes / deviations

- **Dependency correction.** `backlog.md` lists B-006 as depending on B-007, and B-007 as depending on B-006 — circular. Resolution: B-006 (summary shell) is implemented first, B-007 (test plan) is then added *into* that summary. B-007's real dependency is only on B-006 existing. Backlog to be corrected at sprint end.
