# Sprint 0 — Progress Log

**Sprint goal:** the `qalab test` command becomes reliable and its output becomes readable. Nothing changes product behaviour beyond fixing broken behaviour.

### B-001 · Enforce a real timeout on the Playwright runner
| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | **DONE** |
| **Date** | 2026-09-26 |
| **Duration** | 4m |
| **Commit** | `667f634` (1 of 11) |

**What changed**
- `PlaywrightTool`: subprocess stdout/stderr now redirected to a temp file instead of being drained on the calling thread. This is the actual bug — the inline drain blocked until process exit, so `waitFor(60s)` was unreachable and `destroyForcibly()` was dead code.
- Extracted `runProcess(List<String>, Path)` returning a `ProcessOutcome(boolean completed, int exitCode, long durationMs, String output)` record, which makes the timeout path deterministically testable without invoking npx.
- Budget configurable: `@Value("${qalab.playwright.timeout-seconds:600}")`, added to `application.yml` as `qalab.playwright.timeout-seconds`.
- Timeout path: kill tree → `waitFor(5s)` → return `status=TIMEOUT`, `timeoutSeconds`, and an actionable error naming the exhausted budget and how to resolve it (narrow the run, or raise the property).
- Replaced the unbounded `StringBuilder` with `readTail()`: retains at most the last 200 000 chars and announces truncation. Rationale: Playwright prints its per-test summary *last*, so the tail is the informative part — this also replaces the arbitrary 2000-char head-truncation that made output unreadable.
- Temp output file deleted in a `finally` block.

**How it was tested**
- New `PlaywrightToolTest` — 8 cases:
  - `sleep 60` under a 2 s budget is killed (asserts `completed == false` and elapsed < 30 s) — the regression guard for the original defect.
  - exit codes propagate for `exit 0` / `exit 3`.
  - stdout **and** stderr both captured (stderr merged via `redirectErrorStream`).
  - `execute()` with no target returns the "No test file specified" error.
  - `execute()` always returns a structured status and never hangs.
  - `readTail`: keeps the tail marker, announces truncation, is smaller than the original; returns whole small files; tolerates a missing file.
- Full suite: **135 tests, 0 failures** (127 pre-existing + 8 new). No regressions.
- Log inspection confirmed the 2 s budget firing (process started, no matching "execution completed" line).

## Notes / deviations

- **Dependency correction.** `backlog.md` lists B-006 as depending on B-007, and B-007 as depending on B-006 — circular. Resolution: B-006 (summary shell) is implemented first, B-007 (test plan) is then added *into* that summary. B-007's real dependency is only on B-006 existing. Backlog to be corrected at sprint end.
